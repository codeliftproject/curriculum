<a id="connect">2.3: Connecting CSS to HTML</a>
-----------------------------

+ **Read:** [2.3 - Connecting CSS to HTML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_GgtmZXzYgzCvK6d8W9M-lVQHTNTlLRoeVTo7qZ5KY/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift) - *follow along with the code, type it out on your own.*

+ **Key Takeaway:** We can write inline, embedded, or external styles. Because they allow us to keep code separate, and to reuse code, external stylesheets are the preferred method for adding styles to a webpage.
