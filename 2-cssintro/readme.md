<a id="21-intro">2.1: What is CSS?</a>
---------------------

+ **Read:** 2.1 - [What Is CSS?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UmVNXSSO0FxLJ6DC4fLp56OCwSzc4DIp3Q-ejfN9JHQ/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Exercise:** [CSS Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgqYbczJ02v1g0UuU0UvpDICe_QuskctVcg2T-ARGeM/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Key Takeaway:** CSS allows us to add layout and design to web content. Every block of CSS code is a rule that includes a selector, property, and value. 


<a id="22-selectors">2.2: CSS Selectors</a>
-----------------------

+ **Read:** 2.2 - [CSS Selectors](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EWfq-iPtlZqVwO216aBQxb-mGXZRyCNPHdZX3QlKP3c/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Exercise:** [Writing CSS Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-vesHzBzcTi09pknUbOF58rDj_zCxKe-gfCcGUbJ2U/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Read:** [Getting to know CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-css/) (learn.shayhowe.com) - *this chapter is long and includes a lot of extra information. Don’t worry about understanding it all; it will make more sense as you practice. Focus on: general understanding of the cascade and cascade properties, combining selectors, general understanding of hexadecimal colors*
+ **Exercise:** [Using Selectors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NNZFQqjOTkyY5fNM75uRyxJ06-kGMOwxOS8dPpheBzk/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Exercise (Optional):** Sign up for an account at [dash.ga.co](http://dash.ga.co), and complete Lessons 1-3 of Project 1: Build a Personal Website
+ **Key Takeaway:** A CSS selector designates exactly which element(s) within our HTML we want to apply styles to. We can select an element by type, class attribute, or ID.

<a id="23-connect">2.3: Connecting CSS to HTML</a>
-----------------------------

+ **Read:** [2.3 - Connecting CSS to HTML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_GgtmZXzYgzCvK6d8W9M-lVQHTNTlLRoeVTo7qZ5KY/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift) 
+ **Exercise:** [The Cascade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9kDcb8sWqswjdsLEOrY8t_NxieNPSddudXf9SU9YIs/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Exercise:** [Style Your Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-S1xew4NjWkpUIPKLVhB6zzkXwh-lWLSujlny0LcpfM/edit?usp=sharing) (CodeLift)
+ **Read:** [Learn to Code HTML & CSS - Building your first webpage](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/) (learn.shayhowe.com). *Note - this is a great review of everything we’ve covered so far including html & css. Read thoroughly and follow along with the exercises*
+ **Key Takeaway:** We can write inline, embedded, or external styles. Because they allow us to keep code separate, and to reuse code, external stylesheets are the preferred method for adding styles to a webpage.
